Phase 1 - Step 4: Feature/Bug Fix 
Descriptions 
Change Request #1: Fix Export Filename Bug 
Type: Bug 
Description: The program crashes or shows undefined behavior when the user inputs 
invalid characters in the filename (e.g., '/', '?', '*'). 
Proposed Fix: Add input validation to the filename and display an error if invalid characters 
are found. 
Justification: Prevents unexpected crashes and improves user experience. 
Target Class(es): TextEditor.java 

Change Request #2: Add Word Count Feature 
Type: Feature 
Description: Currently, users can't see how many words their document has. Add a dynamic 
word count display in the status bar. 
Proposed Fix: Implement getWordCount() method, add a JLabel in the bottom panel, and 
update word count on each text change. 
Justification: Useful and standard feature in modern text editors. 
Target Class(es): TextEditor.java 

Change Request #3: Refactor Repeated File I/O Code 
Type: Enhancement 
Description: File open/save/export logic is duplicated across several files. This violates the 
DRY principle. 
Proposed Fix: Create a utility class FileUtils.java, and move common methods like 
readFromFile() and writeToFile() there. 
Justification: Enhances maintainability and reduces code duplication. 
Target Class(es): FileManager.java, TextEditor.java 

Change Request #4: Add Dark Mode Option 
Type: Feature 
Description: Many users prefer working in dark mode to reduce eye strain. 
Proposed Fix: Add a menu item “Toggle Dark Mode” and switch background/foreground 
colors of text area and menu bar accordingly. 
Justification: Improves usability and user comfort, especially during long sessions. 
Target Class(es): TextEditor.java
